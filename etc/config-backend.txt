# This file contains all configuration settings used by PSaPP.It is assumed to 
# be in the following format:
# key    = value(s)
# where key is a known string followed by an equals sign `=` and the value(s)
# which can be any string. If the setting contains multiple values, they should
# be delimited with white spaces. Regular expressions may be used with the 
# TestCase and Base Resource settings. The other default config settings may 
# use macros in the following manner:
# A `$` indicates a macro (environment variable) that can be expanded. The
# macro should be enclosed in braces if it is to be expanded and is followed by
# a character other than a white space. The tidle `~` will be expanded to the 
# value of $HOME. Enclose the value(s) string in strong (single) quotes to 
# prevent expansion.
