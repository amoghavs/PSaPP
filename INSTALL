This file describes how to install and run the tools contained in the PSaPP package.

PSaPP has lots of configurable options, as such it uses a config file located
at $PSAPP_ROOT/etc/config.txt to read these options. You need to set the
PSAPP_ROOT environment variable to the root of your PSaPP installation directory.
You should also look through the example configuration files in etc/ and select the 
one best suited to your purpose and make a copy/link of at etc/config.txt.

PSaPP also depends on some external java libraries, which need to be found on
your CLASSPATH in order to run correctly. For the sake of convenience, we provide
these packages in PSaPP/external_libs that you can optionally use.

The easiest way to do this then is to put something like the following commands 
in your shell login script (bash):
export PSAPP_ROOT=/path/to/PSaPP
export CLASSPATH=`ls $PSAPP_ROOT/external_libs/*.jar | tr [:space:] :`${CLASSPATH}


SDSC Notes:
- clear your CLASSPATH before compiling
- prepend /projects/pmac/apps/jdk1.6.0_24/bin to your path since the reference compiler
  is woefully out of date
